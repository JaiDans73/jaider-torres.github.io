I am currently a master’s student at State University of Campinas, interested in algebras with polynomial identities (PI algebra) and its relation to non-commutative geometry and algebraic geometry. My project explores Azumaya Algegras and supergeometry, guided by my advisor’s work on embedding theorems and their connections to supertraces and supergeometry. I am particularly interested in how these concepts relate to advanced mathematical structures such as supergeometry and higher category theory. My academic journey is driven by a deep curiosity about the intersections of algebra, geometry, and their broader implications.

I am currently a master’s student at State University of Campinas, working under the supervision of [Dr. Claudemir Fideles](https://sites.google.com/unicamp.br/fideles/). My project explores PI Algebras and Algebraic Supergeometry, guided by my advisor’s work on embedding theorems as a bridge between Supertraces and Supergeometry. 

Research Interests
------
Broadly, I'm interested in algebras with polynomial identities (PI algebra) and its relation to non-commutative geometry and algebraic geometry. I am particularly interested in how these concepts relate to advanced mathematical structures such as Supergeometry and Higher Category Theory. My academic journey is driven by a deep curiosity about the intersections of algebra, geometry, and their broader implications.
